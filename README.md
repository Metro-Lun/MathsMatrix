## Description
The goal of this project is to have at the end a complete implementation of the mathematical concept of the matrix : transposes, inverses, products, etc.

## Languages and libraries
* Python 3.
* Random library

## How to use it ?
The things you can currently do with this implementation:

### Matrix values
* Change a single value in the matrix
* Change all values to a specific number
* Randomize the values
* Determine if a matrix is the Identity matrix

### Matrix inversibility (for 2x2 matrices only)
* Calculate the determinant of a matrix
* Determine if a matrix is invertible or not
* Determine a matrix's inverse
### Matrix operations 
* Sum of two matrices
* Product of a number and a matrix

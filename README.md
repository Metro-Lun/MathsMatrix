## Description
The goal of this project is to have at the end a complete implementation of the mathematical concept of the matrix : transposes, inverses, products, etc.

## Languages and libraries
* Python 3.
* Random library

## How to use it ?
The things you can currently do with this implementation:

### Matrix values
* Change a single value in the matrix
* Change all values to a specific number
* Randomize the values

### Matrix inversibility
* Calculate the determinant of a 2x2 matrix
* Determine if a 2x2 matrix is invertible or not

### Matrix operations
* Sum of two matrices
* Product of a number and a matrix
